# Gridfinity

More derived designs based on the [Gridfinity](https://thangs.com/search/gridfinity) system by [Zach Freedman](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZackFreedman/about) of [Voidstar Lab](https://www.voidstarlab.com/).

# Custom Designs

These designs are differentiated from others in that they all use a snap fit design for magnet retention instead of glue.

## Materials and Components

Here's a short list of materials used for these designs:

* Designs printed with [Hatchbox White PLA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J0GMMP6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01).
* Magnets are [6mm diameter by 2mm thick "refrigerator" magnets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KJ9H31P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s02).  These are nickel coated Neodymium magnets.
* For bases that will sit on the desk, [silica gel bumper feet(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081J3Q641/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00)] are used.  They really help hold the base in place.  Use a 5 mm diameter by 6.5 mm deep hole for inserting the feet.
* For windows, [microscope slides](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0747R2M26/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00) are used.  When smaller windows are needed, these are cut with [pencil style glass cutting tool](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B3D2G499/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00).

    *Note*: I had tried using the glass slide covers that some with the microscope slides.  However, they're only 0.2 mm thick, and thus very fragile. This is a safety issues, so they are not used.
