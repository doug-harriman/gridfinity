# Hex Bit Holders

![Hex Bit Holders](hex-bit-bins.jpg)

There are [several options available](https://thangs.com/search/gridfinity%20hex%20bit%20holder?scope=all) for hex bit holders for small drivers.  
I took a slightly different approach and created a bin per driver type.  My thinking is that I typically need one driver type (hex, phillips, etc.) at time, so 
just grab the set I'm using.  

Bins are resin printed, and use thin magnets from [KJ Magnetics](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/) below the bits to retain them, yet make them easy to grab.  Lettering/numbering is printed raised, then hit with a Sharpie to highlight the text.

The bins use the snap in magnet geometry common to other bins in this repo.  See other directories for more info.
